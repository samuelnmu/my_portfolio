                I believe in the power of technology to empower businesses and communities. As a passionate software engineer,
                <br> I'm
                driven by the challenge of solving problems and building systems from the ground up. My work is fueled by
                curiosity and
                strengthened by resilience. <br> I thrive on learning, adapting, and creating tools that make a real difference.

        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi, I’m Samuel Ngige Mungai, a Software Engineer specializing in Backend Development. I work with Python (FastAPI,
        Django REST Framework) and  JavaScript (React, Express.js) to craft robust, scalable APIs and systems. Driven by curiosity and a
        passion for building things from scratch, I love solving real-world problems through code.
        
        One of my proudest projects is MatatuPay, a digital system transforming Kenya's  transport industry from cash-based to
        digital payments — a testament to how tech can reshape everyday life.
        
        Outside the terminal, I enjoy watching the stars and strategizing over a game of Monopoly.  I bring an adventurous,
        detail-oriented, and curious spirit into everything I do.
        
        Whether it's startups, businesses, or individuals, I aim to create solutions that make a lasting difference.</p>

                <p>
                    I architect backend systems with scalability, performance, and security in mind. I focus on planning clean APIs,
                    database structures, and workflows that ensure efficiency and clarity from the ground up.

            <div class="service">
                <h1>Development</h1>
                <p>
                    Using technologies like FastAPI, Django REST Framework, and Express.js, I build robust backend systems that power
                    real-world applications. My code is clean, modular, and optimized for performance.
                </p>

            <div class="service-maintenance">
                <h1>Maintenance</h1>
                <p>
                    I ensure systems stay reliable with regular updates, monitoring, bug fixes, and performance tuning. I also refactor
                    legacy code and adapt to evolving requirements to keep products running smoothly.
